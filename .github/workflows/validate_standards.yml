name: validate_standards

# This is a stub workflow to satisfy legacy GitHub branch protection requirements.
# The actual standards validation is now performed in pr_validation.yml (Standards Compliance job).
# This file exists only to prevent "validate_standards - Expected" status from showing as pending.
# See: docs/ops/ci_workflow_architecture.md for current CI architecture.
