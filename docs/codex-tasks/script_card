TARGET_SCRIPT: jobs/vendor_input_processing/matching_proposals/glue_script.py

TASK TYPE: Create Script Card (Phase 1 reverse-documentation)

SPEC (MUST FOLLOW FOR VERIFICATION)
- The Script Card MUST comply with: docs/standards/script_card_spec_v1.0.md
- Use that spec as the acceptance checklist. If any MUST item cannot be satisfied from available evidence, fill the field with "TBD" as permitted by the spec.

CONTEXT (MUST OBEY)
- Repository: vendor-to-pim-mapping-system
- Phase: Phase 1 = document WHAT EXISTS (NO refactoring, NO behavior changes)
- Derivation rule for paths (from TARGET_SCRIPT):
  - job_id = name of the parent folder that contains TARGET_SCRIPT (e.g., matching_proposals)
  - job_manifest.yaml path = same folder as TARGET_SCRIPT, filename "job_manifest.yaml"
  - Script Card output path = docs/script_cards/{job_id}.md
- Input files (sources of truth):
  1) TARGET_SCRIPT
  2) jobs/.../{job_id}/job_manifest.yaml (as derived above)
  3) docs/standards/script_card_spec_v1.0.md
- Output file to create/update (ONLY this file):
  - docs/script_cards/{job_id}.md
- HARD CONSTRAINTS:
  - DO NOT modify TARGET_SCRIPT
  - DO NOT modify job_manifest.yaml
  - DO NOT modify docs/standards/script_card_spec_v1.0.md
  - DO NOT invent behavior or semantics; if not provable, use "TBD"
  - Keep within Script Card scope defined by the spec (no full schemas, no future proposals)

OBJECTIVE
Create (or replace) docs/script_cards/{job_id}.md so it passes every MUST requirement in docs/standards/script_card_spec_v1.0.md, using job_manifest.yaml as the primary source for interface fields and TARGET_SCRIPT only for minimal factual purpose/processing notes.

IMPLEMENTATION RULES (REAL-LIFE BEST PRACTICE)
1) Manifest-first: For Identity/Parameters/Inputs/Outputs/Side Effects, copy values from job_manifest.yaml.
   - If job_manifest.yaml contains TBD, the Script Card MUST also contain TBD for that field.
2) Code-second: Use TARGET_SCRIPT only to:
   - Write the Purpose (1–3 sentences) describing what it produces/changes.
   - Write High-level Processing (4–8 bullets) at action-level, not code-level.
   - List general failure modes and observability cues (no deep internals).
3) No speculation: Do not add details like filename variants, extensions, column names, or filtering criteria unless explicitly present as literal conditions in the code. Otherwise use TBD or high-level wording.
4) Terminology: Do NOT define global terms (e.g., “matching proposal”) in the Script Card. If needed, reference glossary if it exists; otherwise keep wording generic.

DELIVERABLE
- docs/script_cards/{job_id}.md (only file changed)

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (MUST BE VERIFIED)
- The produced Script Card includes all sections and required fields mandated by docs/standards/script_card_spec_v1.0.md.
- All interface fields match job_manifest.yaml (including TBD propagation).
- High-level Processing contains 4–8 action bullets.
- Invariants section contains either ≥1 invariant OR exactly "- TBD".
- No prohibited content per the spec (no full output schemas, no future design, no speculative statements).

PR REQUIREMENTS
- Create a PR that changes ONLY docs/script_cards/{job_id}.md
- In the PR description include a short “Spec Compliance Checklist” section:
  - A bullet list confirming each MUST section exists (Identity, Purpose, Trigger/Parameters, Inputs, Outputs, Side Effects, Processing, Invariants, Failure/Observability, References).
  - A note confirming job_manifest.yaml was treated as primary truth (TBDs preserved).
  - Confirmation that TARGET_SCRIPT was not modified.
