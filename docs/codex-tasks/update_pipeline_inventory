TARGET_JOB_DIR: jobs/vendor_input_processing/matching_proposals/

TASK TYPE: Update Pipeline Inventory (Phase 1 reverse-documentation)

SPEC (MUST FOLLOW FOR VERIFICATION)
- Pipeline inventory must comply with: docs/standards/pipeline_inventory_spec_v1.0.md
- If any value cannot be proven from the allowed sources, write "TBD" (do not guess).

CONTEXT (MUST OBEY)
- Repository: vendor-to-pim-mapping-system
- Phase: Phase 1 = document WHAT EXISTS (NO refactoring, NO behavior changes)
- Allowed sources of truth for this task:
  1) jobs/vendor_input_processing/matching_proposals/job_manifest.yaml
  2) docs/script_cards/matching_proposals.md
  3) docs/business_job_descriptions/matching_proposals.md (if exists; otherwise ignore)
  4) docs/standards/pipeline_inventory_spec_v1.0.md
  5) docs/artifacts_catalog.md (only to reference existing artifact_ids, if present)
- File to create/update:
  - docs/pipeline_inventory.md
- HARD CONSTRAINTS:
  - DO NOT modify any files under jobs/
  - DO NOT modify docs/script_cards/
  - DO NOT modify any standards/spec files
  - DO NOT invent artifacts: inputs/outputs must reference artifact_ids if they exist in docs/artifacts_catalog.md; otherwise write TBD
  - Do not add processing steps or runbook details; keep inventory at system-map level (per spec)

OBJECTIVE
Ensure docs/pipeline_inventory.md exists and contains an entry for job_id=matching_proposals using evidence from the job manifest and (only for business purpose text) the business description/script card. Add dependency links for this job if upstream/downstream relationships are explicitly stated in the sources; otherwise use TBD.

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
1) Open docs/pipeline_inventory.md.
   - If it does not exist, create it following docs/standards/pipeline_inventory_spec_v1.0.md exactly (required headings, Jobs table with correct columns, Dependency links section, Open verification items section).
2) Add (or update) the single row where job_id = matching_proposals:
   - job_dir = TARGET_JOB_DIR
   - glue_job_name/runtime/parameters/side_effects from job_manifest.yaml
   - business_purpose: 1 sentence derived from business description if present; otherwise from script card Purpose; otherwise TBD
   - inputs/outputs:
     - If artifact_ids for the inputs/outputs exist in docs/artifacts_catalog.md, reference them (semicolon-separated).
     - If they do not exist yet, set inputs and outputs to TBD (do not put S3 paths here).
   - upstream_job_ids/downstream_job_ids:
     - Fill only if explicitly stated in sources; otherwise TBD.
   - status: active
3) Under "## Dependency links":
   - Add bullets for any explicit relationships proven by the sources, using the exact format:
     - <upstream_job_id> -> matching_proposals : <artifact_id or TBD>
     - matching_proposals -> <downstream_job_id> : <artifact_id or TBD>
   - If none are provable, add no new dependency bullets for this job.
4) Under "## Open verification items":
   - Add bullets for any remaining TBDs specific to this job (use the required tags), e.g.:
     - [TBD-artifact-catalog] Create artifact_ids for matching_proposals outputs in docs/artifacts_catalog.md.
     - [TBD-wiring] Identify upstream/downstream job_ids for matching_proposals.
   - Do not remove existing open items; only append.

PR REQUIREMENTS
- Create a PR that changes ONLY docs/pipeline_inventory.md
- PR description must include:
  - Which fields were filled from job_manifest.yaml
  - Which fields remained TBD and why (no evidence)
  - Confirmation that no job scripts/manifests/specs were modified
