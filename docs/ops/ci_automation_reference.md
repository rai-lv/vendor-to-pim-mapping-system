# CI / Automation Reference

**Purpose:** Explain what automation runs, what evidence it produces, and how to interpret failures.

**Scope note:** This file only contains the operational CI/validation guidance that previously lived in System Context. Any normative validation rules remain in `docs/standards/validation_standard.md`.

## Standards Validation (CI Gate)

Every PR **must pass** automated validation. See `docs/standards/validation_standard.md` for validation requirements, tools, and CI integration details.
