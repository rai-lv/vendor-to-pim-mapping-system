# Shared Artifacts Allowlist
#
# Purpose:
# This registry defines artifact types that are explicitly allowed to have multiple producer jobs,
# as an exception to the default single-writer rule defined in docs/standards/artifacts_catalog_spec.md.
#
# Governance:
# - Adding an artifact_id to this allowlist requires explicit approval via a decision record (ADR)
# - The decision record MUST document:
#   - Why multiple producers are necessary (business justification)
#   - Coordination mechanism to prevent conflicts
#   - Which job is the canonical owner (primary accountable producer)
#
# Schema:
# Each entry is an artifact_id (string) from docs/catalogs/artifacts_catalog.md
#
# Example:
# - vendor_input__raw_catalog
# - shared_reference__product_taxonomy
#
# Reference:
# See docs/standards/artifacts_catalog_spec.md Section 3.6 for the shared-artifact exception rules.
#
# Current allowlist:
# (Empty - no shared artifacts are currently approved)
#
